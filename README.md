# Tic-Tac-Toe


What is three in a row?

Tic tac toe is a game for two players, which can be played by young children. Although the strategy can be used, it is not necessary for young children to have fun. The object of the game is to roll three X's or O's in a row before your opponent. The three marks can be placed on the diagram vertically, horizontally, or diagonally across the central square of the diagram.

Playing three in a row

Traditionally, X goes first. Players take turns leaving their footprint on an empty square of their choice. A move can be used to further a player's cause of getting three in a row or to prevent the opponent from getting three in a row.

Score three in a row

If a player manages to score three points in a row, they win. Sometimes the victory is accompanied by the comment or shout: "Tic tac toe: three in a row!". If neither player manages to get three of their points in a row, the game is a draw, often referred to as a game of cats.

IT'S TIME TO HAVE FUN!!!!
